                            We partner with local Micro-Supply Hubs (MSHs) who are vetted by our platform. These MSHs are trained to perform standardized quality checks before delivering goods to you. Additionally, our review system allows vendors like you to provide feedback, helping us maintain a high standard of quality and trust.

                            Our micro-loan system is designed to provide quick, short-term capital for vendors to manage their daily cash flow. You can apply directly from your dashboard by specifying the amount and a flexible repayment period (e.g., 2 days, 1 week). Loan applications are subject to a quick admin review.
